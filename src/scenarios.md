A scenario is a simple format game for casual play. One or more circles face off against each other and various threats, as they contend with:

1. [The Score](/scenarios/score.html): Fight over hidden treasure and the things that covet it. A solid introductory scenario.
2. [The Nest](/scenarios/nest.html): Slay great and terrible horrors.
3. [The Tragedy](/scenarios/tragedy.html): Save as many as can be saved; redeem what the others become.
4. [The Trap](/scenarios/trap.html): You are betrayed.
5. [The Gathering](/scenarios/gathering.html): Reveal infiltrators hiding among an unknowing populace.
5. [The Clash](/scenarios/clash.html): A random scenario for experienced players.

## How To Play
After the intentionally vague introduction text, each scenario is described using the following pillars:

- **Setup:** Where and when to set up the models and game elements.
- **Threats:** A scenario will require a number of wild unaligned models to represent dangers or innocents in their way.
- **Special Rules:** Any special rules, such as actions available to godbreakers during the game.
- **Scoring:** How to score the game beyond the basic rules.

### Setup
Before setup, place an objective marker in the centre of the battlefield, then take turns to dress the battlefield until it looks interesting. At least a quater of it should be covered in area terrain, though it is not recommended to go beyond half of it.

During setup, **seniority order** just means: "oldest to youngest", and reverse seniority order means: "youngest to oldest". Players may explore other ways to order setup.

### Threats
The scenario will loosely describe groups of unaligned models that will be encountered during play, including their die value, traits, and any special rules that apply. When determining traits, players may agree based on the model, or roll randomly. Models from a certain group do not need to all have the same traits, though it certainly is easier to keep track of.

It is a good idea for all players to be familiar with these groups, and have models ready to represent each of the threats that may be encountered in the scenarios they intend to play.

#### Traits
There are common types of threats that scenarios will include, and they will specify that they select traits from one of the following tables:

| d8    | Mighty                                | d6    | Sinister                                 |
|:-----:|:------------------------------------- |:-----:|:--------------------------------------- |
| **1** | [Brutal](/rules/traits.html#iron)     | **1** | [Brutal](/rules/traits.html#iron)       |
| **2** | [Deadly](/rules/traits.html#mercury)  | **2** | [Deadly](/rules/traits.html#mercury)    |
| **3** | [Fleet](/rules/traits.html#mercury)   | **3** | [Defensive](/rules/traits.html#copper)  |
| **4** | [Pinning](/rules/traits.html#iron)    | **4** | [Fleet](/rules/traits.html#mercury)     |
| **5** | [Ranged](/rules/traits.html#mercury)  | **5** | [Merciless](/rules/traits.html#mercury) |
| **6** | [Relentless](/rules/traits.html#iron) | **6** | [Vengeful](/rules/traits.html#copper)   |
| **7** | [Tough](/rules/traits.html#iron)      |       |                                         |
| **8** | [Thunderous](/rules/traits.html#gold) |       |                                         |

### Special Rules
A scenario may introduce special rules that alter play, such as actions available for godbreakers to perform during the scenario.

### Scoring
In addition to the victory points gained from marker control as outlined in the basic rules, each scenario will detail how to gain (and lose) victory points.

The winning player of a scenario, if any, may nominate a godbreaker on the battlefield with a die value of less than 10. The nominated godbreaker gains a Triumph.

#### Solo Play
When playing solo, victory points are tallied against the following thresholds to determine margin of victory. During solo games, if a godbreaker is removed as a casualty, the circle _loses_ **5VP**.

| VP Total   | Margin of Victory      |
|:----------:| ---------------------- |
| 10 or less | The day was lost       |
| 20 or more | A respectable victory  |
| 30 or more | A major victory        |

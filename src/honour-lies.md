> A diceless wargame of large-scale fantasy battles

Players should be familiar with the following concepts to enjoy the game:

- [Units](#units): A group of stands operating as a block of troops.
- [Formations](#formations): How units stands are arranged, which can change during play.
- [Bidding](#bidding): The core mechanic to introduce uncertainty and allow soldiers to sell their lives dearly.
- [Disorder](#disorder): Supply mechanics.
- [Terrain](#terrain): Where you fight.

## Units
An army is made up of units, which are made up of a number of stands depending on its type. There are no requirements of what should be taken when building up your army, as long as both sides have the same number of units. All stands in a unit must have two corners in contact with another stand of its unit during play, referred to as _alignment_.

![alignment](/resources/images/honour-lies/alignment.png)
_In the example above, the stands 1, 2 and 3 are in alignment, as they all share two corners in contact with one another. Stand 4 is not, as its corners are not aligned, even if it is in base contact with Stand 3._

If aligning two stands with different orientation, only one corner must be in contact but otherwise the bases must be in full contact.

### Stands
A stand is one or more miniatures on a single rectangular base measuring 60x30mm, filled with multiple miniatures that represent its role and type. A stand may never be placed such that it overlap other stands, friend or foe. Depending on the circumstances, a situation that would cause a stand to overlap another or even be in base contact may trigger a melee or simply remove the overlapping stand.

As the game progresses, units will lose stands to enemy action. Stands are always removed from the rear of the unit. If the last stand in a unit is removed, the unit is destroyed. If a unit is destroyed, all its stands are removed.

### Facing
All units have a front, two flanks (or sides), and a rear facing. The size of each which will change over the course of the game as the unit adopts different formations.

### Sight
Several rules will require a unit to be able to see another. Units can 'see' in all directions, but may only direct attacks toward its forward facing. Terrain, holdings and enemy units block sight if there is no imaginary line that could be drawn that does not pass entirely through.

### Positioning
When a unit is called to be deployed or repositioned, there are some requirements that all players must follow unless explicitly set aside in the specific rules for that circumstance.

#### Deploy or Reposition
When deploying or repositioning a unit, it cannot be in base contact or overlapping any other unit. A unit may be deployed or repositioned into an unoccupied holding, and immediately occupy it as long as it would not immediately be engaged. If a unit would be repositioned or deployed such that it would be disordered (see [Disorder](#disorder)), a stand is destroyed after rebuilding the formation.

### Type
All units must be one of four types: _beasts_, _behemoths_, _cavalry_ and _infantry_. A unit's type determines its orientation, and default values (see: [Army Builder](/honour-lies/army-builder.html#types)).

#### Beasts
Swarms of biting vermin driven before the main force, or perhaps great dogs raised from birth to hunt. They are pure havoc for any general to contend with.

> A unit of beasts consists of four stands, facing toward the shorter edge.

#### Behemoth
Great creatures or engines of war that may well turn the tide of any engagement, but may take longer to thunder into the maelstrom. Those who martial such incredible forces may be appreciably careful in their use or equally struck by their majesty and rely on them to their cost.

> A unit of behemoths consists of three stands, facing toward the shorter edge.

#### Cavalry
Capably trained soldiers granted the privilege of riding into battle. They are best used to harass and break enemy lines, and will suffer if caught out or knocked from their mounts. While some armies use them sparingly, others are entirely built on the backs of mobile warfare.

> A unit of cavalry consists of four stands, facing toward the shorter edge.

#### Infantry
These are the backbone of any force, equipped with heavy armour and the best weapons, or pitchforks and fury.

> A unit of infantry consists of four stands, facing toward the longest edge.

### Role
Every unit must select a role which builds from its type to define its particular capabilities on the field. Certain roles may have fewer stands in a unit, to represent their rarity or poor fighting discipline. Every faction could rationalise any combination, and players are encouraged to experiment for themselves.

The selected role modifies the default values outlined above and the unit will gain special rules that alter how it moves or fights. Should the role provide a ranged modifier, it is calculated from the default attack for its type.

#### Artillery
Rain fire with units that can bring terrible forces to bear, from cunning sorcery or alchemy to even more punishing combinations of the two. While their ranged attacks are tremendous, these units are incredibly ponderous and easily overrun.

#### Berserker
The epitome of crude violence, either warriors of barely restrained fury or creatures driven near mad with hunger. These will absolutely bring the fight to the enemy, but can't take it as well as they can dish it out.

#### Elite
Carefully trained as the greatest soldiers that can be fielded. Dependable, but can struggle if they find themselves cut off.

#### Heavy
Brutes who take the hits and keep on coming. These can hold the centre pretty well, though do not discount them on the attack.

#### Levy
Peasants and mercenaries raised from common stock. There are always more that can be convinced to march, by coin or whip. These are completely disposable troops- better to throw them in to trouble than carefully shepherd them.

#### Monstrous
These mighty warriors swell with magics or speak to a potent genetic legacy. Spawn of old tragedies or terrible curses, and often the last of their kind. Not to be wasted on inefficient targets, so make sure to chose their opponents well.

#### Nightmare
Terrible things called by death. These may be forgotten spirits, shrieking wraiths or cruel fae. Should the nemy hold fast before them, such horrors may find their unreal forms little more resilient than shadow.

#### Scout
Those who move with the land and harass the enemy. Usually creatures or people of the wild, who do not fight for promised riches or glory, but to save their home and kin. Quick, but must choose their targets carefully. Find their flanks, and disrupt supply lines.

#### Wildfire
Wielders of terrible magics or experimental weapons, both as dangerous to the user as the target. At personal risk, they can bring greater pressure to bear at range. Use them before you lose them.

> There may be circumstances that cause a unit to change its role during a game. Recalculate the unit's Attack, Ranged, Defence and Morale values from its type as per normal. A unit's current Health is not affected by switching role. Any special rules a unit has gained from their previous role are replaced with their new one. If they should gain [Rare](/honour-lies/army-builder.html#special-rules), they immediately lose a stand. If a unit which already has Rare should switch to a role that also has it, it would **not** lose a stand.

<hr id="formations">

## Formations
All units must adopt one of the following formations during play: _wall_, _regular_, or _column_. When instructed to rebuild a formation, align the remaining stands until the unit is in its current formation. If the formation cannot be rebuilt due to friendly models, return the unit to its original position. While rebuilding a formation, unless otherwise specified, a stand that cannot be placed without overlapping an enemy stand is destroyed.

Switching between formations is one of the most important tactical challenges of the game. Making sure units are in the right formation at the right time is necessary to achieve victory.

| Wall (max. four stands wide) | Regular (max. two stands wide)     | Column (max. one stand wide)                   |
| :--------------------------: | :--------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
| \[ ^ \]\[ ^ \]\[ ^ \]\[ ^ \] | \[ ^ \]\[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \]\[ ^ \] | \[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \] |

> When rebuilding a wall formation with more than two stands, the player must align a stand either side of the initial one.

<hr id="bidding" />

## Bidding
The lives of soldiers are little more than currency, ruthlessly gambled by their commanders. This game does not rely on dice to represent uncertainty and the fog of war. Instead, players secretly bid on the outcome.

A bid is revealed simultaneously, then players then spend their bid amounts and determine the winner. No player may alter their revealed bid, unless explicitly permitted to by a rule. A player is fully permitted to bid nothing, and bluffing is absolutely encouraged!

The most common bid is the Health bid during [combat](/honour-lies/gameplay#combat). After such a bid, the unit's remaining Health is reduced by the bid amount. A unit reduced to 0 Health in this fashion is immediately destroyed.

<hr id="disorder" />

## Disorder
A war is rarely won or lost by pure violence. The cunning general manages their war materiel and messages on the battlefield better than their troops. If cut off from the chain of command and steady resupply, a unit is in serious trouble.

Units become disordered while they cannot see a friendly command holding, or as a result of a Tactic. Some units are immune to disorder, and can never be affected by it. A unit occupying a friendly command holding is immune to disorder.

A disordered unit affected in the following ways:

- The unit may not be [activated](/honour-lies/gameplay.html#activation)
- The unit bids at a 2:1 ratio in combat, so its combat score is improved by +1 for every **two** Health bid.

<hr id="terrain" />

## Terrain
Terrain may affect movement and combat, and a stand or unit is considered on or within a terrain feature if any part of its base overlaps it.

> Units cannot see through terrain.

A single area of terrain may be one or more combinations of _impassable_, _difficult_, _obscuring_, _high ground_ and _holdings_.

#### Impassable
Any stand or marker placed overlapping impassable terrain is removed.

#### Difficult
A unit within difficult terrain after their first move may not perform their second move.

#### Obscuring
A unit within obscuring terrain increased their defensive base ranged combat score by +1 for each stand within it.

#### High Ground
Hills and ridges improve base combat scores by +1 per stand within it. A unit that is on high ground may also see and be seen through all obscuring terrain, though units cannot see through high ground.

#### Holdings
A holding can represent anything from a hastily erected defensive position to a crumbling watchtower. It is a location occupied by soldiers for defence, and can serve as a place to coordinate strategies.

All holdings are 60x60mm markers, and are considered impassable, obscuring and high ground. However, they may be occupied by a single infantry or cavalry unit. Unoccupied markers are treated as enemy units for engagement purposes, though no combat is fought. While occupying a holding, place a stand from the occupying unit on the marker.

While occupied, a holding is considered friendly to the occupying force. The unit inside is considered to be in regular formation, and entirely within in obscuring, high ground terrain. It can still attack or be attacked, with every edge considered the unit's front.

If a unit is in alignment with an unoccupied holding at the end of a turn, the unit may occupy the holding.

To sally forth from a holding, the unit places a stand in alignment with one of the holding's edges, then rebuild any formation of their choosing. After this step, it may move once.

If an occupying unit is ever forced to retreat, first place the unit in column formation on the opposing side to the winning unit, in alignment and facing the holding, then make a retreat move with the losing unit as normal. If the initial placement or retreat would cause the unit to overlap an unoccupied holding, the retreating unit may occupy it instead. If such a holding is already occupied, even by a friendly unit, the retreating unit is destroyed.

## Units
Players will need an army comprised of an equal number of units. A unit is body of commonly armed or trained warriors, represented using a number of _stands_ in alignment. As the game is played, stands will be lost and units destroyed. Such is the price of victory.

![formation alignment](/resources/images/honour-lies/formation-alignment.png)
_In the example above, the most of the stands are in alignment, as they all share two corners in contact with one another. One is not, as its corners are not aligned, even if it is in base contact._

If aligning two stands with different orientation, only one corner must be in contact but otherwise the bases must be in full contact.

![orientation alignment](/resources/images/honour-lies/orientation-alignment.png)

### Stands
A stand is a single rectangular base measuring 60x30mm supporting any number of 10mm miniatures nominally facing the same direction. All stands have a front, two flanks and a rear facing. This extends to their unit, as all stands must face the same way in addition to remaining in alignment.

While there is not modelling requirement, it is encouraged that each stand clearly present a type of unit clearly, and that all stands in a unit use similar miniatures. The intent is to convey the unit's type and role to the opponent, but players may always ask if it is unclear.

A stand may never be placed such that it overlaps other stands, friend or foe. Depending on the circumstances, a situation that would cause a stand to overlap another or even be in base contact may trigger a melee or simply remove the overlapping stand. Two stands which are only touching at their corners are not considered to be in base contact.

As the game progresses, units will lose stands to enemy action. Stands are always removed from the rear of the unit. If the last stand in a unit is removed, the unit is destroyed. If a unit is destroyed, all its stands are removed.

### Sight
Several rules will require a unit to be able to see another. Units can 'see' in all directions. Terrain, holdings and enemy units block sight if there is no line that could be drawn that does not pass entirely through it.

### Deploy or Reposition
When deploying or repositioning a unit, it cannot be in base contact or overlapping any other unit. A unit may be deployed or repositioned into an unoccupied holding, and immediately occupy it as long as it would not immediately be engaged.

### Type
A unit's type determines its orientation and base attributes: _Attack_, _Defence_, _Morale_, and _Health_. A unit will be one of four types: _beasts_, _behemoths_, _cavalry_ or _infantry_. 

The [Roster Builder](/honour-lies/roster-builder.html#types) will list the attributes for all types.

#### Infantry
These are the backbone of any force, equipped with heavy armour and the best weapons, or pitchforks and fury.

> A unit of infantry consists of four stands, facing toward a long edge.

#### Cavalry
Capably trained soldiers granted the privilege of riding into battle. They are best used to harass and break enemy lines, and will suffer if caught out or knocked from their mounts. While some armies use them sparingly, others are entirely built on the backs of mobile warfare.

> A unit of cavalry consists of four stands, facing toward a short edge.

#### Beasts
Swarms of biting vermin driven before the main force, or packs of hunting dogs raised from birth. They can be pure havoc for either general to contend with.

> A unit of beasts consists of six stands, all facing toward the same edge.

#### Behemoths
Great creatures or engines of war that may well turn the tide of any engagement, but may take longer to thunder into the maelstrom. Those who martial such incredible forces may be appreciably careful in their use or equally struck by their majesty and rely on them to their cost.

> A unit of behemoths consists of three stands, facing toward a short edge.

### Roles
Regular units select a role which builds from its type to calculate its _Melee_, _Ranged_, _Defence_, _Morale_ and _Health_ values, as well as any special rules. Certain roles may limit the number of stands in a unit, to represent their rarity or poor fighting discipline. Players are highly encouraged to experiment with all combinations for themselves, drawing inspiration from their miniature collection.

The selected role uses the type's base attributes to calculate its profile, and may grant the unit special rules that alter how it moves or fights. Should the role provide a ranged modifier, it is calculated from the default attack for its type. The final calculated values and rules are referred to as the the unit's **profile**.

| Attribute | Calculated Values |
| :-------: | :---------------: |
| Attack    | Melee, Ranged     |
| Defence   | Defence           |
| Morale    | Morale            |
| Health    | Health            |

The [Roster Builder](/honour-lies/roster-builder.html#roles) will list the modifiers for all roles, along with a Quick Builder to try them out.

#### Artillery
Examples: _Grenadiers (Artillery Infantry), Cannons (Artillery Behemoths)_

Rain fire with units that can bring terrible forces to bear, from cunning sorcery or alchemy to even more punishing combinations of the two. While their ranged attacks are tremendous, these units will prove slow and may be easily overrun.

#### Berserker
Examples: _Saxon Raiders (Berserker Infantry), Wild Dogs (Berserker Beasts)_

The epitome of crude violence, comprising of warriors of barely restrained fury or creatures driven near-mad with hunger. These will absolutely bring the fight to the enemy, but can't take it as well as they can dish it out.

#### Elite
Examples: _Elven Swordmasters (Elite Infantry), Royal Guard (Elite Cavalry)_

Carefully trained as the greatest soldiers that can be fielded. Dependable, but can struggle if they find themselves cut off.

#### Heavy
Examples: _Dwarf Warriors (Heavy Infantry), Knights of the Black Sun (Heavy Cavalry)_

Brutes who take the hits and keep on coming. These can hold the centre pretty well, though do not discount them on the attack.

#### Levy
Examples: _Peasants (Levy Infantry), Skeleton Destriers (Levy Cavalry)_

Peasants and mercenaries raised from common stock. There are always more that can be convinced to march, by coin or whip, though they are the furthest thing from disciplined. These are completely disposable troops- better to throw them in to trouble than carefully shepherd them.

#### Monstrous
Examples: _Trolls (Monstrous Infantry), War-Mammoths (Monstrous Behemoths)_

These mighty warriors swell with magics or speak to a potent genetic legacy. Spawn of old tragedies or terrible curses, and often the last of their kind. Not to be wasted on inefficient targets, so make sure to choose their opponents well.

#### Nightmare
Examples: _Tormentors (Nightmare Infantry), Dread Coaches (Nightmare Cavalry)_

Terrible things called by death. These may be forgotten spirits, shrieking wraiths or cruel fae. Should the enemy hold their nerve, such horrors may find their unreal forms little more resilient than shadow.

#### Scout
Examples: _Merry Men (Scout Infantry), Outriders (Scout Cavalry)_

Those who move with the land and harass the enemy. Usually creatures or people of the wild, who do not fight for promised riches or glory, but to save their home and kin. Quick, but must choose their targets carefully. Find their flanks, and disrupt supply lines.

#### Wildfire
Examples: _Grenadiers (Wildfire Infantry), Disciple Horsemen (Wildfire Cavalry)_

Wielders of terrible magics or experimental weapons, both as dangerous to the user as the target. At personal risk, they can bring greater pressure to bear at range. Use them before you lose them.

### Specialists
Specialist units calculate values using a combined role. A combined role is made from two roles by taking the better modifier for each value, and gains the special rules from both. These can prove quite characterful, and are a great way to make a force feel thematic and unique.

> Two [Limited](/honour-lies/roster-builder.html#special-rules) roles cannot be combined.

Examples: _Dwarven Hearthguard (Elite Heavy Infantry), Belching Godspawn (Nightmare Wildfire Behemoths)_

<hr id="formations">

## Formations
All units must adopt one of the following formations during play: _wall_, _square_, or _column_. Each formation is defined by how wide each rank must be before a new one may be added. When instructed to rebuild a formation, align the remaining stands until the unit is in its current formation. If the formation cannot be rebuilt due to friendly models, return the unit to its original position. After rebuilding a formation, unless otherwise specified, a stand that could not be placed without being in base contact, or overlapping an enemy stand or a battlefield edge, is removed.

Switching between formations is one of the most important tactical challenges of the game. Making sure units are in the right formation at the right time is necessary to achieve victory.

|          | Rank Width | Example |
| :------- | :--------: | :--------------------------------------------- |
| _Wall_   | 4          | \[ ^ \]\[ ^ \]\[ ^ \]\[ ^ \] |
| _Square_ | 2          | \[ ^ \]\[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \]\[ ^ \] |
| _Column_ | 1          | \[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \]<br />\[ ^ \] |

> When rebuilding a wall formation with more than two stands, the player must align stands on both sides of the initial one.

<hr id="bidding" />

## Bidding
The lives of soldiers are little more than currency, ruthlessly gambled by their commanders. This game does not rely on dice to represent uncertainty and the fog of war. Instead, players secretly bid on the outcome.

A bid is revealed simultaneously; players then spend their bid amounts and determine the winner. No player may alter their revealed bid, but are fully permitted to bid nothing, and bluffing is absolutely encouraged!

The most common bid is the Health bid during [combat](/honour-lies/gameplay#combat). After such a bid, the unit's remaining Health is reduced by the bid amount. A unit reduced to 0 Health in this fashion is immediately destroyed.

<hr id="disorder" />

## Disorder
A war is rarely won or lost by pure violence, but by this measure is the mettle of those fighting brutally tested.

Units become disordered after they make a ranged attack or are defeated in melee. While disordered, a unit affected in the following ways:

- The unit may not perform Ranged Attack or March [actions](/honour-lies/gameplay.html#activation) during its activation.
- The unit bids at a 2:1 ratio in combat, so its combat score is improved by +1 for every **two** Health bid.

If a disordered unit should become immune to disorder, they are no longer disordered. A unit occupying a holding is immune to disorder.

<hr id="terrain" />

## Terrain
Terrain may affect movement and combat for a stand if any part of its base overlaps the terrain feature.

A single area of terrain may be one or more combinations of _impassable_, _difficult_, _obscuring_, and _high ground_.

> Units cannot see through _obscuring_ or _high ground_ terrain, but can see units within.

#### Impassable
Any stand or marker placed overlapping impassable terrain is removed.

#### Difficult
A unit within difficult terrain may not perform a [March](/honour-lies/gameplay.html#activation) action.

#### Obscuring
Every stand counted within obscuring terrain increases their defence score during ranged attacks by +1.

#### High Ground
A unit that is on high ground may see and be seen through all intervening terrain, but units cannot see beyond high ground. Every stand counted on a hill or ridge improves their base melee score by +1.

### Holdings
A holding can represent anything from a hastily erected defensive position to a crumbling watchtower. It is a location occupied by soldiers for defence, and can serve as a place to coordinate strategies.

All holdings are impassable 60x60mm markers. Unoccupied markers are also treated as enemy units for engagement purposes (though no combat is fought). If an infantry or cavalry unit is in base contact with an unoccupied holding at the end of their turn, they may occupy the holding. All other units must retreat.

Once occupied, a holding is considered friendly to the occupying force, even if they leave. While occupied, the unit inside counts all stands when calculating defence, and two when calculating ranged (see [Combat](/honour-lies/gameplay.html#combat)). When defending, every edge considered the unit's front face, and all stands are within obscuring terrain. Units occupying a holding are immune to disorder.

If it has not disordered, a unit may use their Move action to 'sally forth' from a holding. The unit places a stand in alignment with one of the holding's facings, facing away from the holding, then rebuild any formation of their choosing. This is considered an Advance, including the potential to engage in combat.

If an occupying unit is ever forced to retreat, first place the unit in column formation on the opposing side to the winning unit, in alignment and facing the holding, then make a retreat move with the losing unit as normal.

### Core Concepts
This game was written with certain core concepts in mind:
- No dice
- No measuring
- Soldiers lives are the currency of generals

I wanted to enjoy games at a slightly more removed scale of warfare than I was used to playing, where wars are not won by any single act of heroism but by uncounted minor acts of bloody defiance.

In that spirit it is important to recognise unit Health is never lost through enemy action. The decision to inflict Health- for warriors to die- rests entirely with their player. A combat might even be won through necessary sacrifice! In contrast, the removal of stands represents the loss of good order, not casualties. They may be injured or weary, but are still alive and fighting, just for themselves instead of each other. It is the burden of command to decide which fight is worth dying for.

I have had fun digging into the many interesting games that support this scale, including _Argatoria_, _Dragon Rampant_, _Dux Bellorum_, _Fantasy Battles_, _Restless Hordes_ and _Warmaster_, among others. I'd encourage folk to give all of them a try.

### Alternative Scales
While the game assumes players will use 6-15mm miniatures, ultimately, this game is intentionally free of measurment. The only real requirement is that both players are using the same stand size, which is rectangular and has a long edge twice the length of the short edge.

Beyond that, the game should scale easily to meet existing collections or personal preference.

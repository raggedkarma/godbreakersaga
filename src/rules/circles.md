When creating a circle, each player must fill out their [roster](/resources#downloads) with the following:

- **Name:** Something inspiring or meaningful, or at least memorable.
- **Fights For:** What drives this circle as individuals and binds them as a group.
- [Shard](#shard): A marker that grants a trait to the entire circle at rank one.
- [Godbreakers](#godbreakers): Two D8 and three D6, plus additional details.

These can be completed in any order, as players may be inspired in different ways.

## Shard
While creating a circle, the player must pick a [trait](/rules/traits.html) for their shard. While their shard marker is present on the table, godbreakers of the circle may use its trait as if they had it at rank one. Once selected, a shard trait may not be changed.

When deciding on a shard marker, players are encouraged to embrace their creativity. The marker needs to be quickly identifiable on the tabletop, and could also convey the shared trait in some way.

_For example: a circle has a Ranged shard, and has a godbreaker with a Ranged rank of one. This godbreaker may use the trait at rank 1, not at a combined rank of 2. The player decides to use an ammunition crate as the marker to represent the shard on the battlefield._

## Godbreakers
There are always five godbreakers in any circle. Should a player ever have fewer than five before a game, they must add new models to bring the number of godbreakers back up to five. These new godbreakers have a die value of 6.

At creation, a circle has two godbreakers with a die value of **8**, and three **6**. The first godbreaker on the roster is the **leader**.

For each new godbreaker, complete the following steps:

1. **Metal:** Select one: [Copper](#copper), [Iron](#iron), [Mercury](#mercury) or [Gold](#gold).
2. **Traits:** Gain two traits as described below, plus an additional one for the leader.
3. **Name:** Think of something to call them, or that they might call themselves.

<hr id="gaining-traits" />

## Gaining Traits
Every time a godbreaker gains a trait, the player may either select it from the model's metal list, or raise the rank of an existing trait by one.

> _No godbreaker may have more than four traits, or take any trait above rank 3._

| d6    | [Copper](#copper) | [Iron](#iron) | [Mercury](#mercury) | [Gold](#gold) |
|:-----:|:------------------|:--------------|:--------------------|:--------------|
| **1** | Defensive         | Brutal        | Cunning             | Despoiling    |
| **2** | Healer            | Juggernaut    | Deadly              | Ruinous       |
| **3** | Inspired          | Pinning       | Fleet               | Shaping       |
| **4** | Mysterious        | Relentless    | Merciless           | Summoning     |
| **5** | Vengeful          | Tough         | Ranged              | Thunderous    |
| **6** | _Alloy_           | _Alloy_       | _Alloy_             | _Alloy_       |

### Crucible
If the player wishes, a godbreaker may instead gain a random trait from a metal of their choice. If the player does not like the result, they may discard it to raise the rank of an existing trait by one if they are able to do so.

#### Alloy
If the player keeps an Alloy result, the godbreaker combines the chosen metal with any they already have, then selects a trait from its list at rank 1.

The model must also be given a new flaw from the following table:

| Flaws       |                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brittle** | Increase all damage suffered by one                                                   |
| **Careful** | May only perform the Engage action once per activation                                |
| **Prey**    | Wild models within their movement range of this model gain the _Predator_ compulsion. |
| **Slow**    | May only perform the Move action once per activation                                  |
| **Unlucky** | All _challenging rolls_ of **4 or less** have a result of 0.                          |

> _**Predator:** Inflict damage on the closest model with the Prey flaw._

<hr id="ascension" />

## Ascension
After a godbreaker ascends, messengers force them to undergo brutal trials. This punishes godbreakers for imagined transgressions, but perhaps grants an opportunity to prove themselves worthy of devotion. Those who fail are spat back into the mortal realm, their strength drained but their resolve burning brighter than before.

After a game is fully completed, including any rewards or other bookkeeping, godbreakers that have ascended may return to their circle. Upon their return:

- The model must gain a trait, [selected as normal](#gaining-traits), and;
- The model's die value is set to **6**.

If a player does not choose to return a godbreaker from ascension, or has four traits at rank 3 and therefore cannot gain or increase a trait, they **never** come back.

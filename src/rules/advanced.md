These are not required to play the game, but may prove interesting or useful to experienced players.
All players must agree before using any of the rules described here.

<hr id="special-actions">

## Special Actions
These are in addition to the special actions listed under [actions](/rules/gameplay.html#actions).

#### Ready
As a special action, the active model claims a new ready token and their activation ends.

> #### Ready Token
> If a _hostile_ model is placed within the attack range of a model carrying a ready token, the inactive model **must** remove their ready token from the game and make an Engage action. Only the active model may be nominated for this action, regardless of traits or other abilities. If the hostile model was placed as part of an action, players should complete that action fully before resolving this action.
>
>
> All ready tokens are removed from the game at the end of the round, or if they are ever [unclaimed](/rules/#game-elements).

<hr id="terrain-levels" />

## Terrain Levels
The vertical height of the battlefield is divided into slices parallel to its floor, known as **levels**. The height of terrain levels should be led by the miniatures or terrain at hand, such as a building with multiple floors. At minimum it should allow clearance for all models and markers in play to stand upright.

When placing terrain, all players should agree which level(s) it applies to.

### Measuring
If measuring between an origin and destination point that are on different terrain levels, the range is affected as follows:

- If the origin and destination points are **more than** one terrain level apart, they are always [out of range](/rules/#measures-ranges).
- For the first half of the distance, terrain only applies if it is on the origin's terrain level. Terrain on the destination's level only applies for the second half.

_For example: Assuming default scale, a player is measuring from a model to another just over 8" away, who is also one level lower. There is area terrain across the entire lower level, but none on the upper level. The first 4" are without terrain, so 4U. The second half is affected by the lower level area terrain, so 8 units. The means that the target model is within 12U._

_For example: A model standing on a tower two terrain levels high may not engage a model standing on the battlefield, as they are **out of range**._

### Additional Obstacles
When moving, the following additional obstacles may apply:

- **Climb/Fall:** The destination terrain level is above or below the model's original level.

### Really Unstable Placement
A model affected by the [unstable placement](/rules/#measures-ranges) rule may require being placed on a different level. If so, increase the damage caused for unstable placement by the number of levels difference the model ends up.

_For example: A model two terrain levels high moves into a clear area _without_ changing their terrain level as part of the move action. As the model cannot physically float in the air, they must be placed on the battlefield, taking one damage for unstable placement. They then take an additional two for the terrain level difference, for a total of 3._

### New Trait: Unbound
A model may adjust their terrain level up to their _Unbound_ rank **before** determining range. While using terrain levels, it's encouraged for models with wings or a jetpack to gain a rank or more in this trait.

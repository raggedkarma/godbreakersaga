## Special Rules

### Disciplined
For every Health bid during combat, this unit's combat score is improved by an additional +1, for a total of +2. A disordered & disciplined unit bids Health as if neither rule applied.

### Expendable
At the start of a round, if this unit is destroyed, you may deploy a new unit of the exact same type and role to your deployment area in column formation.

### Limited
This unit has one fewer stands for its type, so infantry and cavalry units have three, while behemoths would have only two.

### Rush
For step 2 of the activation flow, this unit may choose to move instead of making a reform.

### Slow
This unit uses a reduced activation flow when activated:

1. Ranged Combat
2. Reform or Move
3. Close Combat

### Swift
This unit may make a second move even if it is within difficult terrain.

## Strategy
If using the advanced rules, all players must select a **faction** when building their army. Each faction introduces a Strategy value, which is used during setup to determine Initiative and purchase one-use abilities called **tactics**. Some factions have an army rule that may improve or hinder units of a certain type, role or specific combination of both. All factions also provide a short list of unique tactics unique to them that may be purchased for only those armies.

### Setup
When determining which player has the Initiative during setup, players instead bid up to the Strategy value for their army faction. The highest bidder claims the Initiative, and both players now spend their remaining Strategy to purchase tactics.

<hr id="tactics" />

## Tactics
Multiple uses may be purchased for each tactic costing less than 3. Players are not required to disclose which exact Tactics they have, but must share the cost of each.

Tactics will indicate when they may be used. If two or more could be used at the same time, the player using them may select the order. The player with Initiative may resolve any tactics that they wish to play before their opponent.

If a tactic ever causes a unit to gain Health, it is permitted this may take it above its starting amount.

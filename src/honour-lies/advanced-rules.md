If using the advanced rules, forces gain Heroes, must bid Strategy to determine first player, and may play a number of Orders during a round. The rules for each are presented below.

<hr id=heroes />

## Heroes
Players gain one Hero per four units in their army, and each one must be assigned to a different unit before the game. While an impressive miniature on a 30mm base is recommended, players may simply use a card token. It is highly encouraged to name your Heroes and give them interesting backstories.

If using miniatures, these are deployed in contact with the front rank, but for all purposes they are not a stand. If a unit is ever removed from play or destroyed, their assigned Hero is also removed from the game.

> Heroes are not a stand, so are ignored for moving, lines of sight, and never counted in combat.

When moving a unit with a Hero miniature, it is recommended to set the model aside, move the unit as normal, then place the Hero back in alignment.

### Wisdom
For each Hero in play, the Strategy for their force is increased by +2.

### Duty
While a unit has a Hero assigned to them, they gains a +1 bonus to its calculated Morale value.

### Sacrifice
During combat, after both sides have revealed their Health bid, a player may sacrifice the unit's Hero. Remove the sacrificed hero from the game then increase the unit's final combat score by +3.

## Strategy
At the start of each round, each player builds a Strategy pool. All forces have a base Strategy of 2, plus an additional two per Hero on the field.

> **Strategy** = 2 + (+2 per remaining Hero)

### Initiative
At the start of each round, players must bid for the Initiative using their Strategy. If both players bid the same amount during the first round, the youngest player gains the Initiative. During later rounds, a tied bid results in the previous round's second player gaining the Initiative.

As normal, the bid amount reduces the remaining Strategy, which is spent during the round to perform Orders.

<hr id="orders" />

## Orders
When building a force, each player must also select **three** Orders. Orders may represent a commander's improvisation or preparation, or perhaps just demonstrate a primal cunning. There is no restriction on which Orders may be taken, but this is considered part of the force list, so must be made available to your opponent before any battle begins.

When a unit is activated, either player may use an Order by paying the related cost from their remaining Strategy. If both players want to use an Order, the first player determines which is resolved first. If a player does not have enough Strategy to cover the cost of using a declared Order, nothing happens and no Strategy is spent.

> Each player may only use one Order per unit activation, and each Order may only be used once per round.

#### Modify Attribute
Orders that modify attributes refer to the calculated unit profile. No modification can raise an attribute beyond double or reduce it below 0.

#### Friendly Units
Orders that refer to **friendly units**, mean those from the same force as the active unit.

#### Ruin(X)
If Ruin(X) affects a unit, that unit must either:
- Remove a stand, **or**;
- Lose X Health.

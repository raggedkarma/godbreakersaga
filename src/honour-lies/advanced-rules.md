<hr id="strategy" />

## Strategy
If using the advanced rules, all players must select a **faction** when building their army. Each faction introduces a Strategy value, which is used during setup to determine Initiative and purchase one-use abilities called **tactics**. Some factions have an army rule that may improve or hinder units of a certain type, role or specific combination of both. All factions also provide a short list of unique tactics unique to them that may be purchased for only those armies.

### Setup
To seize the Initiative during setup, players must instead bid using their Strategy, as determined by their faction. The highest bidder claims the Initiative. If Strategy bids are tied, both players lose a single point of Strategy (regardless of their bid amount) and must bid again. If both players have no Strategy left, the youngest player seizes the Initiative.

<hr id="tactics" />

## Tactics
Tactics are single-use special effects that represent cunning ploys, dangerous magics, or bitter experience. After the Initiative has been seized, players spend their remaining Strategy to purchase tactics. Players may purchase any combination of Common tactics and those unique to their faction. Tactics costing 1 or 2 may be purchased more than once.

> Players are required to share the cost of each Tactic they have at all times, but are not required to disclose each specific tactic until they are used.

Tactics will specify a trigger that determines when they can be played. If two or more could be used for the same trigger, the player using them may select the order, but the player with Initiative may resolve any tactics that they wish to play before their opponent. Multiple copies of a tactic cannot be played for the same trigger.

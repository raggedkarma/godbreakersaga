If using the advanced rules, forces gain Heroes, a Strategy rating, and a number of Orders. The rules for each are presented below.

<hr id=heroes />

## Heroes
When building a force, both players add one Hero for every four stands. While an impressive miniature is recommended to represent these mighty individuals on the battlefield, players may simply use a card token. It is highly encouraged to name your Heroes and give them interesting backstories.

After deployment, starting with the second player, each Hero is assigned to a different unit. If using miniatures, these are deployed in contact with the front rank, but for all purposes they are not a stand. If a unit is ever removed from play or destroyed, their assigned Hero is removed from the game.

> Heroes are not a stand, so are ignored for moving, lines of sight, and never counted in combat.

When moving a unit with a Hero miniature, it can be easier to set the model aside, move the unit as normal, then place the Hero back in contact.

### Duty
While a unit has a Hero assigned to them, they gains a +1 bonus to its calculated Morale value.

### Sacrifice
During combat, after both sides have revealed their Health bid, a player may sacrifice the unit's Hero. Remove the sacrificed hero from the game then increase the unit's final combat score by +3.

## Strategy
Each force's initial Strategy rating is equal to the number of regular units in it. This is a limited resource which is used during setup to determine Initiative and to allow a force to use Orders during the game.

### Setup
To seize the Initiative during setup, players must instead bid using their Strategy. The highest bidder claims the Initiative, and both must spend their bids as normal. If Strategy bids are tied, both players lose a single point of Strategy (regardless of their bid amount) and must bid again. If both players have no Strategy left, the youngest player seizes the Initiative.

<hr id="orders" />

## Orders
When building a force, each player must also select **three** Orders. Orders may represent a commander's improvisation or preparation, or perhaps just demonstrate a primal cunning. There is no restriction on which Orders may be taken, but this is considered part of the force list, so must be made available to your opponent before any battle begins.

When a unit is activated, either player may use an Order by paying the related cost from their remaining Strategy. If both players want to use an Order, the first player determines which is resolved first. If a player does not have enough Strategy to cover the cost of using a declared Order, nothing happens and no Strategy is spent.

> Each player may only use one Order per unit activation, and each Order may only be used once per round.

#### Modify Attribute
Orders that modify attributes refer to the calculated unit profile. No modification can raise an attribute beyond double or reduce it below 0.

#### Friendly Units
Orders that refer to **friendly units**, mean those from the same force as the active unit.

#### Ruin(X)
If Ruin(X) affects a unit, that unit must either:
- Remove a stand, **or**;
- Lose X Health.

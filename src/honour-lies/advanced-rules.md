If using the advanced rules, forces gain Heroes, must bid Strategy to determine first player, and may play a number of Orders during a round. The rules for each are presented below.

<hr id=heroes />

## Heroes
Players gain one Hero per four units in their army, and each one must be assigned to a different unit before the game. While an impressive miniature on a 30mm base is recommended, players may simply use a card token. It is highly encouraged to name your Heroes and give them interesting backstories. No Hero may be assigned to an [Expendable](/honour-lies/roster-builder.html#special-rules) unit.

If using miniatures, these are deployed in contact with the front rank, but for all purposes they are not a stand. If a unit is ever destroyed, their assigned Hero is removed from the game.

> Heroes are not a stand, so are ignored for moving, lines of sight, and never counted in combat.

> A Hero attached to a Summoned unit deploys with that unit.

When moving a unit with a Hero miniature, it is recommended to set the model aside, move the unit as normal, then place the Hero back in alignment.

### Wisdom
For each Hero in play, the Strategy pool for their force is increased by +1.

### Duty
While a unit has a Hero assigned to them, it gains a +1 bonus to its calculated Morale value.

### Sacrifice
During combat, after both sides have revealed their Health bid, a player may sacrifice the unit's Hero. Remove the sacrificed hero from the game, then increase the unit's final combat score by +5.

## Strategy
At the start of each round, each player builds a Strategy pool equal to the half number of friendly units on the battlefield (rounding up), then adds +1 per friendly Hero in play.

### Initiative
At the start of each round, players must bid for the Initiative using their Strategy. If both players bid the same amount during the first round, the youngest player gains the Initiative. During later rounds, a tied bid results in the previous round's second player gaining the Initiative.

The bid amount reduces the remaining Strategy, which is spent during the round to perform orders.

<hr id="orders" />

## Orders
Orders may represent a commander's improvisation or preparation, or a Hero's cunning or unnatural power.

When a unit is activated, its controlling player may pay Strategy to use one or more orders. Each order reduces a player's remaining Strategy by one, and if a player does not have any Strategy remaining they may not declare further orders. Heroic orders may only be used by units with an assigned Hero.

> The same order may not be used more than once per unit activation.

#### Modify Attribute
Orders that modify attributes refer to the calculated unit profile, within the following limitations:

- No attribute can ever be modified by more than +/- 1.
- Health can never be raised above the unit's starting value.

> Attributes other than Health are only modified for the rest of the round.

#### Ruin
If `Ruin` affects a unit, that unit must either:
- Remove a stand, **or**;
- Lose 2 Health.

#### Rally
If `Rally` affects a unit, that unit must:
- Regain a stand, **and**;
- Lose 2 Health.

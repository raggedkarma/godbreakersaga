<hr id="type-majority">

## Force Majority
If a fully readied force has more units of a certain type and/or a certain role, that is considered a majority. If players have agreed to use advanced rules, different majorities will confer additional force rules, Strategy modifiers and specific orders. Specialist units are considered to be **both** of their combined roles to determine if the force has a role majority. 

Players can develop their force to have a particular style using these rules, especially in combination with specialist units. There are some examples provided below.

### Force Rules
The following rules apply to forces depending on the **type** majority:

- **Infantry:** All friendly infantry units may reform for free after a Retreat.
- **Cavalry:** If a friendly cavalry unit is fled through by either a beast or infantry unit, it does not lose a stand.
- **Beasts:** After seizing the Initiative, this unit may ready one additional regular beast unit.
- **Behemoths:** All friendly beast and infantry units consider friendly behemoth units as command holdings for the purposes of disorder.

<hr id="strategy" />

## Strategy
If using the advanced rules, each force has a Strategy value, which is used during setup to determine Initiative and during the [Prepare Orders](#orders) phase at the start of each round. All forces have Strategy equal to the number of regular units in their force, adjusted for majority as follows:

#### Type Majority:
- Infantry: **+2**
- Cavalry: **+1**
- Behemoths: **-1**
- Beasts: **-2**

#### Role Majority:
- Elite/Scout: **+2**
- Artillery/Heavy: **+1**
- Levy/Wildfire: **-1**
- Berserker/Monstrous/Nightmare: **-2**

### Setup
To seize the Initiative during setup, players must instead bid using their final Strategy amount. The highest bidder claims the Initiative, and both must spend their bids as normal. If Strategy bids are tied, both players lose a single point of Strategy (regardless of their bid amount) and must bid again. If both players have no Strategy left, the youngest player seizes the Initiative.

<hr id="orders" />

## Orders
Orders represent a capable general using talents for improvisation or preparation. All forces will have a selection of orders available to them from which they can prepare each round. This selection is made while building the force, and includes all common orders, those for its type majority, and a single General order.

In the advanced game, rounds are broken up into the following phases:

1. Prepare Orders
2. Open Orders
3. Activations

During the Prepare Orders phase, starting with the second player, players take turns to prepare orders. Orders are prepared by spending remaining Strategy, from the selection made when building a force.

### Prepare
Players must share the Strategy cost of any order they prepare, but keep the specific order secret. Players can prepare any number of orders, though only one of each order can be readied per round.

### Open Orders
Orders without a trigger are considered 'open', and are revealed during this phase, starting with the first player. Many open order effects last the entire round, though some take immediate effect.

### Activations
This phase proceeds as normal for the round, however if a situation occurs that matches the trigger condition for an order, it may be played. Should both players have orders with the same trigger, the first player has the final say which is resolved first.

At the end of a round, all orders are discarded and their Strategy costs are fully recovered.

### Common Effects
Some orders effects are pretty standard, and are presented below.

#### Type/Role Specific
Some orders may only affect units of a specific type or role. Specialist units count as both of their roles to be targeted for such orders.

#### Modify Attribute
Some orders may indication attribute modifications, and these all refer to the unit profile. No modification can raise an attribute beyond double or reduce it below 0.

#### Ruin(X)
If Ruin(X) affects a unit, that unit must either:
- Remove a stand, **or**;
- Lose X Health.

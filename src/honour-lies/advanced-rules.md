<hr id="strategy" />

## Strategy
If using the advanced rules, all players must select a **faction** when building their army. Each faction introduces a Strategy value, which is used during setup to determine Initiative and during the [Ready Orders](#orders) phase at the start of each round. Some factions have an army rule that may improve or hinder units of a certain type, role or specific combination of both. All factions have a selection of orders unique to them which only those armies can use.

### Setup
To seize the Initiative during setup, players must instead bid using their chosen faction's Strategy. The highest bidder claims the Initiative. If Strategy bids are tied, both players lose a single point of Strategy (regardless of their bid amount) and must bid again. If both players have no Strategy left, the youngest player seizes the Initiative as normal.

<hr id="orders" />

## Orders
In the advanced game, rounds are broken up into the following phases:

1. Ready Orders
2. Open Orders
3. Activations

During the Ready Orders phase, starting with the second player, players take turns to ready orders. Orders are readied by player's spending remaining Strategy. Orders may be selected from common orders and those unique to their faction.

### Ready
Players must share the Strategy cost of any order they ready, but keep the specific order secret. Players can ready any number of orders, though only one of each order can be readied per round.

### Open Orders
Orders without a trigger are considered 'open', and are revealed during this phase, starting with the first player. Many open order effects last the entire round, though some take immediate effect.

### Activations
This phase proceeds as normal for the round, however if a situation occurs that matches the trigger condition for an order, it may be played. Should both players have orders with the same trigger, the first player has the final say which is resolved first. 

At the end of a round, all orders are discarded, even if unplayed.

### Common Effects
Some orders effects are pretty standard, and are presented below.

#### Ruin(X)
If Ruin(X) affects a unit, that unit must either:
- Remove a stand, **or**;
- Lose X Health.

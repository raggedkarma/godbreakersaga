_Cruel fate has led all parties to this dreadful reckoning._

<hr id="setup" />

## Setup

1. In order of seniority, each player must place their circle's shard marker outside 6U of the centre, then roll on the Hunt table and place the models or markers indicated.
    - **If playing solo**, roll three times and use the two lowest results.
2. In reverse seniority order, each player places a godbreaker within its move range of their shard marker. Continue until all models have been deployed.

| d6    | Hunt Table    | Place the following:                                                                               |
|:-----:|:------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Hunters**   | Two Hunters, each within 0U of a different marker                                                  |
| **2** | **Horror**    | One Horror within 6U of the centre                                                                 |
| **3** | **Locals**    | Five Locals outside 6U of your circle's shard marker                                               |
| **4** | **Treasure**  | A Hidden Treasure marker outside 6U of any other marker                                            |
| **5** | **Objective** | An objective marker outside 6U of any other marker                                                 |
| **6** | **Follower**  | One Follower within 2U of your circle's shard marker, and one Hunter within 0U of any other marker |

## Threats

### Hunter
_Cold-hearted killers who have been tracking your circle for some time. Best to make an end of it._

A D10 model with the _Ranged_ trait at rank one, and a **Sinister** trait at rank 2. All Hunters treat other Hunters as _friendly_.

### Horror
_What is THAT?_

A large, or notably threatening, D12 model with the _Tough_ trait and rank one, and two **Mighty** traits.

### Local
_Their people begged you for their safe return._

A D6 model with no traits.

### Follower
_They seek to become equal to their heroes, and the circle has come to appreciate their company._

A D10 model with two **Sinister** traits at rank 2, and the following special rule:

- This model is tamed before the game starts by the circle that rolled this result.

### Forgotten
_Wretched, pitiable things, long-since lost to their desperate need._

A D8 model with the following special rules:

- If a Forgotten is within 0U of an unclaimed treasure token at the end of its activation, it claims it.
- While there is at least one treasure hoard marker on the battlefield, Forgotten gain the _Mine!_ compulsion.

> _**Mine!:** If any model is carring a treasure token, inflict damage on the closest one. Otherwise, claim the closest unclaimed treasure token, or move within 0U of a treasure hoard marker._

## Special Rules

### Plunder
As a special action, a godbreaker who's player is in control of a treasure hoard marker may claim a new treasure token and make a _What's That Sound?_ test:

> #### What's That Sound?
> _Failure:_ Place a Forgotten within 0U of the active model.

### Trophies
After removing a Horror as a casualty, place a new trophy token where it stood.

<hr id="scoring" />

## Scoring
If a Follower is ever removed as a casualty, the circle that they are tamed by _loses_ **10VP**.

For every Hunter or Local removed as a casualty, determine the closest model controlled by a player and adjust the victory point tally for their circle:

- Hunter: gain **5VP**
- Local: _lose_ **1VP**

If there are models controlled by multiple players all equally close, no victory points are gained or lost.

At the end of the final round, circles gain **10VP** for every godbreaker carrying one or more trophy tokens, and **5VP** for every godbreaker carring one or more treasure tokens.

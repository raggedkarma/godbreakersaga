_Word has spread of a power hidden here. Something buried and forgotten, that may yet hunger for the light._

<hr id="setup" />

## Setup

1. In order of seniority, each player must place their circle's shard marker outside 6U of the centre, and a treasure hoard marker outside 6U of any shard marker.
2. In reverse seniority order, each player places a godbreaker within its move range of their shard marker. Continue until all models have been deployed.
3. **If playing solo**, place five Forgotten on the battlefield, at least one must be within 0U of the objective marker, the rest within 0U of the treasure hoard marker.

## Threats

### Forgotten
_Wretched, pitiable things, long-since lost to their desperate need. Harden your heart to their sorry state, for it is of their own making._

A D8 model with no traits and the following special rules:

- If a Forgotten is within 0U of an unclaimed treasure token at the end of its activation, it claims it.
- While there is at least one treasure hoard marker on the battlefield, Forgotten gain the _Mine!_ compulsion.

> _**Mine!:** If any model is carring a treasure token, inflict damage on the closest one. Otherwise, claim the closest unclaimed treasure token, or move within 0U of a treasure hoard marker._

## Special Rules

### Plunder
As a special action, a godbreaker who's player is in control of a treasure hoard marker may claim a new treasure token and make a _What's That Sound?_ test:

> #### What's That Sound?
> _Failure:_ Place a Forgotten within 0U of the active model.

_They do not know what stalks amongst them. Act with all haste, for others might learn their secrets._

<hr id="setup" />

## Setup

1. In order of seniority, each player must place their circle's shard marker outside 6U of the centre.
2. In reverse seniority order, each player places a godbreaker within its move range of their shard marker, and a Local outside 6U of that model. Continue until all models have been deployed.
3. **If playing solo**, place a Hunter within 0 units of any marker.

<hr id="threats" />

## Threats
For this scenario, Hunters are _friendly_ to all other Hunter models.

### Local
_They regard us with suspicion. They have no idea._

A D6 model with no traits.

### Hunters
_The mimicry was uncanny. Its fury upon discovery is unrelenting._

A D10 model with _Ranged_ trait at rank one, and a **Sinister** trait at rank 2.

<hr id="special-rules" />

## Special Rules

### Verify
Any active godbreaker within attack range of a Local may use a special action to remove that model from the battlefield and make a _This Will Hurt..._ test:

> #### This Will Hurt...
> _Success:_ The active model's circle gains **1VP**. Their player may place an Hunter within 6U of the active model. If the removed Local had taken damage, the new Hunter takes the same amount.
>
> _Failure:_ The active model's circle _loses_ **1VP**

<hr id="scoring" />

## Scoring
For every Hunter or Local removed as a casualty, determine the closest model controlled by a player and adjust the victory point tally for their circle:

- Hunter: gain **5VP**
- Local: _lose_ **1VP**

If there are models controlled by multiple players all equally close, no victory points are gained or lost.

_A dark legacy now nests close to claimed territory, threatening all. It is past time these blasphemies and their spawn were laid low._

<hr id="setup" />

## Setup

1. In order of seniority, each player must place their circle's shard marker outside 6U of the centre.
2. In reverse seniority order, each player places a Horror within 6U of the centre.
3. In seniority order, each player places a godbreaker within its move range of their shard marker. Continue until all models have been deployed.

<hr id="threats" />

## Threats
For this scenario, all Horror and Spawn are _friendly_ to all other Horror and Spawn models.

### Horror
_What is THAT?_

A large, or notably threatening, D12 model with two **Mighty** traits, **and** one _Tough_ rank.

### Spawn
_Though somewhat removed from that which came before, their nature is immediately apparent. "Cute", they are not._

A D8 unaligned model with two **Mighty** traits, and the following special rule:

- If any model on the battlefield has claimed a trophy token, Spawn gain the _Avenger_ compulsion:

> _**Avenger:** Inflict damage on the closest model carrying a trophy token._

## Special Rules

### Breeding Grounds
If there is a godbreaker within 0U of the central objective during the start of the round, something crawls from the nest. If the winning initiative result is greater than 7, place a Horror (otherwise, a Spawn) within 0U of the central objective marker.

### Spawning
When a Horror is being removed as a casualty, the final player in priority order may place a Spawn within 2U of it before the model is removed.

### Trophies
After removing a Horror as a casualty, place a new trophy token where it stood.

## Scoring
At the end of the final round, circles gain **10VP** for every godbreaker carrying one or more trophy tokens.

---
_That which corrupts does its work, for all a tragedy truly requires is time. You offer two types of redemption. Only one is proven._

<hr id="setup" />

## Setup

1. In order of seniority, each player must place their circle's shard marker outside 6U of the centre.
2. In reverse seniority order, each player places a godbreaker within its move range of their shard marker, and a Lost outside 6U of that model. Continue until all models have been deployed.

<hr id="threats" />

## Threats

### Lost
_They are afraid, and ravaged by a corruption they do not understand. You may not be able to save them all, but perhaps in their name others will be spared._

A D6 model with the following special rules:

- At the start of each round, all Lost take one damage.
- Lost models treat all Recovery rolls as _challenging_.
- When a Lost would be removed as a casualty, place a Damned within 0U of it before removing it.

### Damned
_Oh no._

A D8 model with the Fleet trait, and the following special rules:

- Damned models treat all Recovery rolls as _challenging_.
- All attack rolls while engaged with a Damned model are _challenging_.

<hr id="special-rules" />

## Special Rules

### Treatment
Any active godbreaker within 0U of a Lost may use a special action to remove that model from the battlefield and make a _Field Trials_ test:

> #### Field Trials
> _Success:_ The active model's circle gains **2VP**.
>
> _Failure:_ Place a Damned within 0U of the active model.

<hr id="scoring" />

## Scoring
For every Damned removed as a casualty during the Recovery phase, determine the closest model controlled by a player. That model's circle gains **5VP**. If there are models controlled by multiple players all equally close, no victory points are gained.

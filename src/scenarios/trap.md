_Their hatred was a subtle thing at first, but now it has driven them beyond reason. Betrayal hurts every time. You intend to make sure._

<hr id="setup" />

## Setup

1. In order of seniority, each player must place their circle's shard marker outside 6U of the centre, and an objective marker outside of 6U of any shard marker.
2. In reverse seniority order, each player places a godbreaker within its move range of their shard marker. Continue until all models have been deployed.

## Threats

### Betrayer
_They would look unremarkable, if not for the idolent fury that radiates off of them. Their weapons, notably, are clearly not of their making._

A D8 model with the _Brutal_ and _Deadly_ traits at rank one, and the following special rules:

- As a special action, if within 0U of a circle shard marker, this model may nominate it and make a _[Destroy Marker](/rules/gameplay.html#actions)_ test.
- While there is at least one shard on the battlefield, Betrayers gain the _For The Broken!_ compulsion:

> _**For The Broken!:** Destroy the closest shard marker._

<hr id="special-rules" />

## Special Rules

### The Reckoning
At the start of every round, place a new Betrayer model within 0U of _every_ objective marker on the battlefield.

## Scoring
There are no additional scoring rules for this scenario.

Good luck.

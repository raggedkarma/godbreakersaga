Players should be familiar with the following concepts to enjoy the game:

- [Models](#models): A single miniature representing a threat.
- [Die Roll](#die-roll): To resolve risk in a model's action, such as an attack.
- [Measures & Ranges](#measures-ranges): Gauge if a model is permitted to perform an action, or if a rule or effect may apply.
- [Game Elements](#game-elements): Important pieces to clearly present the state of play.
- [Battlefield](#battlefield): A flat area set aside for play, preferably with some terrain to place on it.

## Models
All threats in the game are each represented by a miniature, or other visually distinct game element. While this game is nominally written for 28mm miniatures, it adapts easily to any scale. It is encouraged that all players take models from the same scale and genre. Models should have a base that it stands on appropriate for its scale, as it is used to measure to and from the model.

A model may never be placed such that it overlaps another model (including its base), [marker](#game-elements) or a [barricade](#battlefield).

- **Die Value (D):** All models have an even die value from 6 to 12 that represents their might.
- **Circle:** Five godbreaker models and a shard marker.
- **Hostile & Friendly:** Game terms that are used to determine the eligibility of a target for certain rules.
- **Unaligned:** Unaligned models are minor threats that may be allies or prove dangerous. Wild models act based on their current compulsion.
- **Traits & Flaws:** Special rules that make a model behave uniquely on the table.

### Die Value (D)
All models use a die value, or **D**, as a numerical measure of its might, either: **6**, **8**, **10** or **12**. This value encapsulates their abilities, skills, gear, and overall experience.

### Circle
Every player must bring a circle to play a game. A circle is physically respresented on the table by five **godbreakers** and a **shard marker**. The shard marker should be easily identifiable, using a miniature or a distinct counter.

#### Godbreakers
These are exalted individuals that make up a circle. They will grow in power over the course of a single game, and carry their newfound strength into later games.

Any model that is not a godbreaker is **unaligned**.

### Hostile & Friendly
By default, all models controlled by a player are *friendly* to all other models controlled by that player, and *hostile* to all other models. Unaligned models treat all models as hostile, even other unaligned models.

A rule that affects hostile or friendly models is considered from the perspective of the model that implements the rule, and if not specified will affect all models.

### Unaligned
Most unaligned models are introduced as threats and will belong to a loosely defined group. It's encouraged to select models that fit the theme presented.

#### Tame
A tame model is fully controlled by a player, but is never considered a member of their circle. As they are controlled by a player, tame models are friendly with that player's other models.

#### Wild
Wild models have a compulsion that determines how they act when they are activated, if at all. If rule should cause an unaligned model to gain a compulsion, the new one overrides the previous one. If lost, the previous is used as before.

The default compulsion for unaligned models depends on their die value. A wild D6 model is *Cowardly*, otherwise it is *Murderous*:

> ***Murderous:** Inflict damage on the closest hostile model.*

> ***Cowardly:** If within 0U of a hostile model, move as far as possible away from that model.*

### Traits & Flaws
These alter how a model fights or moves, or even allow them to change the battlefield itself. A model may have up to three ranks (**R**) in a single [trait](/rules/traits.html), and no model may have more than four traits. A flaw may only be gained once.

<hr id="die-roll" />

## Die Roll
If a rule requires a model to roll, its player must roll a die of a size equal to the model's die value and use the number rolled as the result.

_For example: a D8 model would roll an 8-sided die or "d8"._

- **Rerolls:** a reroll condition may require a model to reroll their die.
- **Challenging Roll:** A challenging roll of 3 or less is a 0 result.
- **Triumph:** When a godbreaker rolls the maximum for their die value, their die value permanently increases (such as a D6 to D8).

### Rerolls
Some abilities or circumstances will specify a reroll condition, usually a specific type of roll with certain value or less. If any condition applies, the player **must** reroll the die until the value no longer meets the condition, which is then used as the result.

### Challenging Roll
When there is particular difficulty or risk, the roll may be classified as challenging. A challenging roll of 1, 2, or 3 is treated as a result of **0**.

#### Tests
A test is provided with outcomes for success and/or failure. The model makes a challenging roll. If the result is greater than 0, apply the outcome for success, otherwise apply the failure. If there is no outcome provided for the test result, such as succeeding a test with no success outcome, then nothing happens.

### Triumph
As godbreakers come to embrace their destiny, they transcend their mortal origins. Such moments of triumph are sudden, breathtaking eruptions of unrestrained power.

Every time a godbreaker's roll result is the maximum for their current die, they gain a Triumph:
- The model immediately removes all damage taken, _and_;
- After the action or result has been fully resolved, the model's die value is permanently increased by 2.

_For example: The godbreaker Nexus (D8) has an attack result of 8. They immediately remove all damage and, after the engage action has been completed, they are now a D10 model._

The model's new die value is used in all future games using the same circle, until it changes again, either by Triumph or:

#### Ascension
If a D12 godbreaker ever gains a Triumph, they are buoyed by incredible divine power. Messengers feel the call to witness such glories, bursting forth in a great host. Though initially awestruck or lovesick, they swiftly turn cruel and they drag the godbreaker back to their realm. Players might imagine this scene is accompanied by the clear sound of trumpets, an epic guitar solo, or a lot of screaming.

Once their current action has fully resolved, instead of increasing the model's die value, the D12 model Ascends and is **removed from the battlefield**.

Any tokens claimed by a godbreaker are taken with them during their Ascension, and considered claimed at the end of the game, but otherwise they are completely beyond all mortal concerns.

The model may return in a future game, though not the same as they left. See [Ascension](/rules/circles.html#ascension) for more information.

## Measures & Ranges
Many rules and effects are limited by the range between the model using the rule and an intended target. It is encouraged that all players be familiar with how to account for distance in _The Godbreaker Saga_, especially if you are familiar with other wargames.

- **Distance:** All distances are measured in a straight line, parallel to the battlefield.
- **Units (U):** Used to abstract from measurements to ranges, rounded down. If playing with ~28mm minis: between 1 and 2 inches is 1 Unit.
- **Within Range:** Determine if a rule or effect applies.

### Distance
Measuring to determine the distance between two specific points is always done in a straight line, from origin to destination, parallel to the battlefield. Assuming players are playing on a horizontal surface such as a table, this means all distances are measured horizonally. When measuring to or from a model, use the closest point of its base.

Any player can measure any distance at any time.

#### Without Bases
It is heavily encouraged for all models and markers to have bases appropriate for their scale (such as the one provided with the miniature). If they do not, players must agree before the game which parts are considered it's 'base' for rules purposes.

### Units
All ranges are presented in _units of measurement_ (**U**), which are taken from the measuring scale used, rounded down. Players can agree on whatever suits their model scale or measuring devices on hand.

> By default measurement is in inches, so <1" = 0U, and 2-3" = 2U.

### Within Range
All rules or effects specify a range to determine if they can be applied. A model may only affected by a rule, such as being nominated during an engage action, if they are within range.

To determine if a model, game element or piece of terrain is within range: measure the shortest distance between and round down to the nearest unit. This measure is then compared to the required range:
- If the measure is less than or equal to the required range, it is _within range_, and the rule or affect may be applied.
- If the measure is greater than the required ranged, it is _out of range_, and the rule or effect cannot be applied.

_For example: Assuming default scale, a player is measuring from their model to a point just over two inches away. The point is within 2U (or two units of measurement) range of the model. Later, a player is measuring from their model to another under an inch away. The models are within 0U of each other._

#### Place Within / Outside
If a model or game element must be placed within a specified range, no part of the model's base may be outside it. If they must be placed outside, no part of the model's base may be within.

#### Unstable Placement
If a model, marker or barricade should ever be placed in a position that cannot physically fit or support it, it is instead placed as close as it can where it won't fall or overlap. If it is a model, it then suffers a point of damage.

#### Closest
When determining the closest model to another, this is considered by units of range. If two models are within the same range, the player activating the model may decide which is closest.

#### Movement Range
All models have a base **movement range** of their die value in units (**DU**).

#### Attack Range
All models have a base **attack range** of 0 units (**0U**).

<hr id="game-elements" />

## Game Elements
These are important game elements used to determine the current state of the game.

- **Markers:** Distinct game elements that may be controlled by different circles over the course of a game.
- **Tokens:** Small chits or counters to represent a minor boon or important item.
- **Damage:** Represented using whichever method is easiest, but often tokens or dice.

### Markers
Markers are distinct game elements with a base, and are preferably similar in size to other models being used. A marker cannot be placed on top of a [model](#models), [barricade](#battlefield) or another marker.

#### Marker Control
For most games, control of certain markers may determine victory. A player controls a marker if there are more godbreakers of their circle within 0U of it than all other models within 0U of the marker combined.

_For example, a lone godbreaker stands beside an objective marker: their player controls it. Elsewhere, two godbreakers from the same circle stand beside a marker which also has two hostile models within 0U: their player does **not** control it._

_For example, a godbreaker and their tamed unaligned model both stand beside a shard marker: their player does **not** control the marker._

### Tokens
These represent a minor boon or item that may be acquired by a model in certain circumstances. Tokens are grouped by type and not interchangeable, so a treasure token cannot be used as a trophy token, for example.

A token on the battlefield is considered **unclaimed** until a model **claims** it. If a model is ever removed as a casualty, any tokens it had claimed are placed on the battlefield within 0U of where they stood, and are now unclaimed.

### Damage
This is an abstraction of fatigue and failing courage, as well as physical pain. As models suffer damage, their will to continue to fight is tested, and they may be overcome. This is an important game state to keep track of, and it is best to make this clear. 

<hr id="battlefield" />

## Battlefield
The designated space for play is known as the **battlefield**, and should be a flat area set aside for the game.

- **Size:** A battlefield must be at least 20U across at its widest point.
- **Setup:** When setting up a game, players take turns adding terrain pieces, until at least half the surface area is covered.
- **Barricades:** On obstacle that favours engaged models which can take advantage.
- **Area Terrain:** Hinders movement and ranged engagements.

### Size
The battlefield must be at least 20U wide, and should be no larger than 35U for games with fewer than four players. Nothing may be placed such that it overhangs the edge of the battlefield.

### Setup
When setting up a game, players take turns dressing the battlefield using terrain pieces. Terrain may be placed that is neither area terrain or a barricade to make the game look better and support the general theme. All players must agree during setup which terrain rules (if any) apply to which feature.

### Barricades
Barricades are an unbroken line of defensible terrain no more than 1U wide, though it can curve or corner at any point. Certain actions are impacted if they determine their range across one, as explained under [Actions](/rules/gameplay.html#actions).

A barricade cannot be placed on top of a [model](#models), [marker](#game-elements) or another barricade.

#### Impassible
A notably impregnable barricade may be declared impassible. No measure or range can be drawn across an impassable barricade. Note this means that the shortest distance between models is one that does not cross an impassible barricade.

### Area Terrain
Area terrain may be modelled as a single piece, or multiple pieces might be arranged to describe the area. When a rule applies to area terrain, this includes all pieces that are used to define it. Some parts of area terrain may also be **barricades**, such as dense walls.

When determining if something is within range, increase the measurement by one unit for each full unit that crosses area terrain. If measured across overlapping area terrain, there is no additional or cumulative effect.

_For example: Assuming default scale, a player is measuring to a model a little over five inches away, and the measurement crosses just under three full inches of area terrain. The model is within 7U._

When area terrain is placed on a table, any game pieces already present must be replaced on top of it, as close to their original positions as possible. This may potentially cause [unstable placement](#measures-ranges).

## Expanded Damage

### Damage Table
When an aircraft suffers a damaging hit, roll on the Damage table instead of causing it to lose a point of Structure. If the roll is a 4+, a point of Structure is lost as normal (ðŸ’¥), then the result effect is applied.

| D6  |    | Effect |
| :-: | -- | ------ |
| 1   |    | The aircraft turns to face a random direction. Number the sides of the base of the aircraft and roll a D6, then turn the aircraft to face the direction indicated. |
| 2   |    | Place a ðŸ’¨ Smoke token near the aircraft or its card. |
| 3   |    | Place a ðŸ”¥ Flame token near the aircraft or its card. |
| 4   | ðŸ’¥ | The aircraft immediately falls into a Spin. |
| 5   | ðŸ’¥ | Place a ðŸ’¨ Smoke token near the aircraft or its card. |
| 6   | ðŸ’¥ | Place a ðŸ”¥ Flame token near the aircraft or its card. |

> **ðŸ’¨ Smoke**
>
> An aircraft with one or more Smoke tokens on it may not fire in the Tailing Fire phase and suffers a -1 modifier to all hit rolls when firing in the Firing Phase.

> **ðŸ”¥ Flame**
>
> An aircraft with one or more Flame tokens on it may not fire in the Tailing Fire phase or the Firing Phase, and reduces its Manoeuvre characteristic by 1, to a minimum of 1. Otherwise it follows all the normal rules.

###  End Phase
During the End Phase, between the Recovering From a Spin and Tailing steps, all aircraft with one or more Smoke or Flame tokens must attempt to remove them. To remove either type of token, roll a D6 and compare the result to the aircraft's Handling characteristic. If the result is equal to or higher than the aircraft's Handling characteristic, the token is removed. Do this for each Smoke or Flame token the model has.

If the result of the roll is lower than the aircraft's Handling characteristic, roll another D6 and consult the table below for the appropriate token:

| D6    | Smoke            | Flame         |
| :---: | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 1 - 2 | ðŸ’¨ &raquo; ðŸ”¥    | ðŸ’¥            |
| 3+    | Nothing happens  | ðŸ”¥ &raquo; ðŸ’¨ |

> A token cannot be removed during the same End Phase in which it was placed

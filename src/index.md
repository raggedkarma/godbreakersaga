### Introduction
Welcome to _The Godbreaker Saga_, an omnipotent skirmish wargame. The gods are dead- fight to inherit their power!

This game might be for your group if any of the following appeal:

- **Your World:** Players can use any models in their collection to tell their saga, limited only by their imagination.
- **Quick Setup & Play:** A handful of models can be forged into a playable force in minutes, with games (including setup) lasting an hour or so at most.
- **Unlimited Players:** Supports any number of players, including solo.
- **Core Progression:** Your models will gain in power through play- even during a battle... but not without risk.
- **Engaging Play:** Players are never kept waiting, and every roll matters.
- **Deep Gameplay:** Multiple paths to victory will keep even experienced players on their toes.

Have fun!

## Setting Details
The game is intended to be completely playable with whatever genre of miniatures players happen to have on hand. Regardless of the setting the players agree to use, the following are true:

- **Gods Beyond:** There were powerful beings that transcended understanding who used to reside beyond this realm in domains of their own creation. Though called â€˜gods', players may think of them as ancient aliens, totemic ur-spirits or AI bound to subspace nano-assemblers.
- **The Breaking:** A recent act of brutal deicide, with no known survivors. The might of those beyond was scattered among mortal champions, elevating some of them to nascent godhood.
- **Messengers:** The gods made their wills known through lesser beings personally created or elevated for the task. These messengers are now near-mad with grief.
- **Godbreakers:** Once mortal, but now imbued with shards of divine power. Messengers hate and love them in equal measure, blaming them for the Breaking, but hoping they may serve as replacement gods.

## Minimum Needed To Play
To play the game, players will need the following items:

- ~10 **models** per player, at least **five** of which have strong main character energy;
- A table and some **scenery**;
- A measuring device;
- A collection of **dice**, at least one 6, 8, 10 and 12-sided;
- Counters, beads, tokens or similar **game elements**.
- A **scenario**, chosen from this site, or elsewhere

#### Models
These are your heroes and the dangers they face. A "model" may be a lego figure or piece of candy, though actual miniatures are absolutely preferred. The important thing is that it is immediately clear where everything is in the game, and all players are enjoying themselves.

#### Scenery
These are used to ground the conflict in a world of your making, and introduce variety to the games you play. It can comprise anything from paper cut-outs with 'swamp' written on them and toy blocks as low walls, to more elaborate setups.

#### Dice
The classic set of many-sided dice can be found at any gaming store and even certain bookstores these days. They only dice explicitly needed from that set are the d6, d8, d10 and d12 dice. Only one set is really needed, but having at least one per player is ideal.

#### Game Elements
Understanding the state of play is a lot easier with a collection of counters, coloured beads, or small dice. These can be acquired from gaming stores, craft shops, or players can tear up a piece of paper and write on it.

#### Scenarios
A scenario is a single encounter, and will detail how to setup models, introduce threats, and how to score progress beyond the core rules. Scenarios are intended to scale to any number of players, and work for any theme.

#### Rules
Looks like all that is left is to read the [Rules](/rules)!
